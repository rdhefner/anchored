## 5. Adding Book Cover Images

### Required Images:
Your site expects these image files in the `/public/` directory:

```
/public/
â”œâ”€â”€ hero-bg.jpg           (Hero section background - IMPORTANT!)
â”œâ”€â”€ book-cover-launch.png (Launch book cover - Ages 12-14)
â”œâ”€â”€ book-cover-navigate.png (Navigate book cover - Ages 14-16)
â””â”€â”€ book-cover-anchor.png (Anchor book cover - Ages 16-18+)
```

### Steps:
1. Save your book cover images with the exact names above
2. Place them in the `/public/` folder
3. Recommended dimensions:
   - Book covers: 400x600px minimum (2:3 aspect ratio)
   - **Hero background: 1920x1080px minimum (landscape orientation)**
4. Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)

### Background Image Tips:
The hero background (`hero-bg.jpg`) is used across all hero sections with a navy gradient overlay, so:
- Choose an image that works well darkened (the overlay is 60-70% opacity)
- Works best with: nature scenes, textures, subtle patterns, or abstract backgrounds
- Avoid: busy images with important details, faces, or text (they'll be hard to see under the overlay)
- The image is responsive and will crop/scale on different screen sizes
- Focus important visual elements in the center of the image for best results on mobile

**Note:** The placeholder images currently in use will automatically be replaced when you add your own images with these names.

## 6. Cinema Sunday Font (Optional)

The site is configured to use the **Cinema Sunday** font for the main "Anchored" title (matching your book cover).

### If you have the font file:
1. Create a `/public/fonts/` directory
2. Add your font files:
   ```
   /public/fonts/
   â”œâ”€â”€ cinema-sunday.woff2
   â””â”€â”€ cinema-sunday.woff
   ```
3. The font is already configured in `globals.css`

### If you don't have the font file:
The site will fall back to Merriweather (serif), which still looks great. You can purchase or find Cinema Sunday font online if you'd like to add it later.

---

## 7. Testing Your Setup

### After configuring everything:

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test each feature:**
   - âœ… Click all navigation links
   - âœ… Test the email signup form (homepage)
   - âœ… Test the contact form (contact page)
   - âœ… Click all "Get the Series" buttons (should go to your Amazon link)
   - âœ… View on mobile and desktop

3. **Check for console errors:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any red errors in the Console tab

---

## 8. Deploying to Vercel

### Add Environment Variables to Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** > **Environment Variables**
3. Add each variable from your `.env.local` file:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AMAZON_SERIES_LINK`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_API_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY`
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy your site

## 9. SEO & Metadata

All pages already have proper SEO metadata configured. You can customize them in each page file:

- Homepage: `src/app/page.tsx`
- How It Works: `src/app/about/page.tsx`
- Series: `src/app/series/page.tsx`
- Contact: `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Email signup not working?
- Check that your ConvertKit API key is correct
- Make sure the Form ID matches your ConvertKit form
- Check browser console for errors

### Contact form not working?
- Verify your Web3Forms access key is correct
